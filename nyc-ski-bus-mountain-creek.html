  - 
    Q: What time do we leave Hunter Mountain?

  - 
    Q: Is lunch included?

    Q: Are there lockers available at the lodge?
    A: Yes, there are lockers for use at the lesson center right after you go through the rental line. You can also leave anything you might need on the bus, as it will be safely secured for the entire day.
  - 
    Q: Do you need to know how to ski in order to go?
    A: Nope! One of the reasons for Liftopia Ski buses is to get more people out to the mountains, so they can learn to love snow sports as much as we do. To get a good start, we recommend a discounted group lesson or a Learn to Ski/Snowboard package.
  - 
    Q: Are lessons available for purchase?
    A: Yes! 90-minute lessons are available for just $25 (Normally $35) if you book in advance on our site.
  - 
    Q: Can I take the bus up on one day and the bus back on another?
    A: Unfortunately the bus transportation is only valid for use within a single day. This is to ensure that all of our customers have available seats for the return to journey to NYC on any given day.
  - 
    Q: Can I drive myself?
    A: Unfortunately driving yourself is prohibited. We do this for logistical and liability reasons.
